**Back to Start** is a fast-paced, one-screen arcade platformer where you canâ€™t stop â€” literally.

Trapped in a looping arena, your character auto-moves from side to side. Dodge hazards that evolve each cycle and score a point every time you survive the full loop.

* âš¡ Constant automatic movement
* ðŸ§  Simple rules, challenging execution
* ðŸŽ® Made in ~10 days for the *Untitled Game Jam*.

> Note: This is an early jam version. More updates may come in the future!
