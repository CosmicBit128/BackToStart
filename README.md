**Back to Start** is a fast-paced, one-screen arcade platformer where you canâ€™t stop â€” literally.

Trapped in a looping arena, your character auto-moves from side to side. Dodge hazards that evolve each cycle and score a point every time you survive the full loop.

* âš¡ Constant automatic movement
* ðŸ§  Simple rules, challenging execution
* ðŸŽ® Made in ~10 days for the *Untitled Game Jam*.

> Note: This is an early jam version. More updates may come in the future!

### How to play
* When you press **[<]**/**[A]** or **[>]**/**[D]** the player starts moving automatically in the selected direction.
* Press **[W]** or **[Space]** to jump.
* Avoid falling into lava.
* When you bounce from the wall at the end, you score a point.
* There are 3 types of platforms:
  - **Normal:** Default, you can normally stand on it
  - **Yellow:** You can jump onto it from bottom
  - **Aqua:** You can bounce and change direction (you don't get a point from it)
